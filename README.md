A real-time translation platform that enables seamless communication across language barriers. Interpify uses advanced AI technology to provide instant translation and voice conversion, allowing people speaking different languages to communicate naturally.

## Features

- Real-time voice translation between multiple languages
- Push-to-talk functionality with space bar support

## Privacy & Security

Interpify is designed with privacy in mind, implementing several features to protect user data:

- **Disposable Rooms**: All chat rooms are temporary and automatically disposed of when users leave. No conversation history is stored on the server.
- **Automatic Data Cleanup**: 
  - Audio files are immediately deleted after processing
  - Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
  - No conversation logs or transcripts are retained
  - Room data is cleared from memory when sessions end
- **Local Processing**: All audio processing happens in real-time and is never stored permanently
- **Maximum Duration**: Audio clips are limited to 60 seconds for security
- **File Size Limits**: A 10MB file size limit is enforced to prevent abuse

These features ensure that your conversations remain private and temporary, with no data persistence beyond the active session.
